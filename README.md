# Dragonfly egg for Pterodactyl

An egg used to run Dragonfly inside of Pterodactyl.

> Dragonfly is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software written in Go. More information can be found on their GitHub [repository](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly) and their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/U4kFWHhTNR)

## Installation

Just import the `egg.json` file into your Pterodactyl panel and you're good to go! The script and Docker image will be automatically updated on each server start.

## Warning

My egg implementation is clearly not the best I could've written, but it works. Feel free to open a pull request fixing what you think has to be fixed.
